<h2>New update 

  <body>
<pre>5 months ago I found a canon EOS 1D and one good lens and a macro lens
 ,but the batteries are dead and we can't find the charger for it,
so I found an AC adaptor that plugged into a battery 
and plugged it into my camera and got it working.
I did find an empty SD card to put on the camera although
we still need to find the charger and once I do I'll be using 
my professional camera rather than my phone.</pre>
